Welcome to your new TanStack Start app!

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Database & seeding (Pokedex)

Local data is PostgreSQL + [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/). [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) is the source of truth for the seed.

1. **Start Postgres** (Docker must be running):

   ```bash
   npm run db:up
   ```

2. **Apply schema** (creates all Pokedex tables):

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. **Seed from PokeAPI** (first run can take a while; responses are cached under `.seed-cache/` so re-runs are fast):

   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Inspect data** (optional):

   ```bash
   npm run db:studio
   ```

Other scripts:

- `npm run db:down` — stop containers (data kept in the Docker volume).
- `npm run db:reset` — remove the volume, start fresh, `db:push`, then full `db:seed`.

Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` (default matches `docker-compose.yml`).

**Seed CLI flags**

- `--no-cache` — ignore `.seed-cache` and refetch everything.
- `--concurrency=8` — max in-flight HTTP requests (default `8`).
- `--only=stages` — comma-separated subset, e.g. `--only=generations,species,pokemon`.
- `--limit=N` — only process the first `N` entries from each list endpoint (smoke test).

**Rough row counts after a full seed**

| Table             | Approx. count         |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `pokemon`         | ~1,300                |
| `pokemon_species` | ~1,025                |
| `moves`           | ~900                  |
| `abilities`       | ~300–400              |
| `types`           | 20                    |
| `pokemon_moves`   | large (all learnsets) |

Spot-check Pikachu (`pokemon.id = 25`): types, abilities, `pokemon_stats`, and many rows in `pokemon_moves` should be present.

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `npm install @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss -D`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting. Eslint is configured using [tanstack/eslint-config](https://tanstack.com/config/latest/docs/eslint). The following scripts are available:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run check
```

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])

  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
